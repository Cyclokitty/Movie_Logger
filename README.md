Laura Veee's Movie logger
=========================

This is MongoDB University Week 1 Challenge Answer

* create movie entries
  - need 3 input fields: title, year, imdb and a submit button
  - set up a route to handle a POST request
  - double check in mongo shell that the movie logs properly

* as a bonus I added a routing to show all the movies in the database
  - not quite working yet!
